# This file contains information calculated by the diagnostics program from
# the data. As such, it may not agree with what is found in the log-sheet or
# database. The format of the entries in this file may evolve as new tests
# are added to the diagnostics code. Each line contains a version number which
# can be used to determine the format of the data it contains.
#
